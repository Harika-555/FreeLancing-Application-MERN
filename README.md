# Freelancing Application – MERN Stack Freelancing Platform

This project showcases a full-stack freelance job marketplace built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Inspired by platforms like Upwork and Freelancer, it enables seamless interaction between clients and freelancers with features such as project bidding, real-time messaging, secure payments, and role-based access.

The application was developed as part of an academic and self-learning initiative to apply core full-stack development concepts, Agile planning, and real-world functionality into one integrated system.
